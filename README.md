## The World's Most Affordable Haptic Glove?
With a small budget to work with, this project might possibly the world's most affordable haptic glove ever created for consumers and DIY
enthusiasts. A price table can be shown giving the relatively average price of each item with its price. 

The cost is obviously dependent on
what resources you already have available, but if you're starting from scratch, or are missing key components, this table is for you. If
you're looking at this page, you'll probably find you have most of these items already.

Item  | Price
:---:    | :---:   
Pair of Gloves  | $9.99
Leap Motion Dev. Kit  | $89.99
Arduino Uno Rev 3 | $22.00
Piano Fingers / Mount (Optional) | $4.99
Haptic Motors (x5) | $3.99
Wires | N/A (Depends)
-- | --
Total Cost | $130.96

>While this may seem like a hefty DIY project, it is still possibly the most affordable haptic glove that's available at the moment. Most haptic
gloves start at around $200, excluding tracking. With Leap Motion camera tracking, you'll be able to have hand tracking at an affordable
price.
